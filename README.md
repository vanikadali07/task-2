🌟 Task 2 Completed – ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd Internship 🌟

This time, I didn’t just design a webpage —
I crafted an elegant space where interaction meets aesthetics. 💄✨

For Task 2, I was challenged to move beyond layout basics and focus on enhancing the user experience through clean design, smart validation, and dynamic interactivity — all in one seamless webpage.

🔥 What did I build?

💅 “Beauty Bliss” – A Responsive Webpage
A stylish, interactive webpage where users can contact us and manage their favorite beauty products — with a sleek design and a smooth user flow.

✨ Why this approach?

“Because websites shouldn’t just work — they should feel beautiful.”
“Because great design is not decoration — it's thoughtful interaction.”

🎯 What I implemented:

📬 A polished Contact Form – fully responsive and accessible
✅ Live JavaScript Form Validation – intuitive and user-friendly
📝 A dynamic Beauty Product List – inspired by a To-Do list layout, with timestamps, delete options, and smooth animations
🌙 Dark Mode Toggle – for a soft and elegant night-friendly experience
🎨 Elegant Font Styling & Color Theme – featuring Times New Roman and a soft, modern color palette
💡 Subtle Animations – for smooth, refined interactions
📱 Responsive Design – adaptable to all screens with Flexbox and Grid

💻 Tech Stack Used:
• HTML – for clean structure
• CSS – for elegant styling and themes
• JavaScript – for validation and interactive DOM logic

“Beauty Bliss isn’t a full app — it’s a graceful webpage that blends form and function with style.”
